Goal: Allows users to save birthdays and will notify the user when a birthday is approaching.

How: To create an application where a user can input birthdays of their friends, family etc, and for the program to save these birthdays in a file.

Coding Aspects Implement:
- input/output
- potentially GUI
- using date and time

Features:
- let user input name, birth date, and relation to the person
- potentially show birthdays in calender view, or otherwise in a list view (sorted with upcoming birthdays at the top)
- send a reminder a week in advance of a birthday (or allow the user to specify when to send it)
